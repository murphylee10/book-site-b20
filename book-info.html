            Molly Gray is not like everyone else. She struggles with social
            skills and misreads the intentions of others. Her gran used to
            interpret the world for her, codifying it into simple rules that
            Molly could live by. Since Gran died a few months ago,
            twenty-five-year-old Molly has been navigating life's complexities
            all by herself. No matter—she throws herself with gusto into her
            work as a hotel maid. Her unique character, along with her obsessive
            love of cleaning and proper etiquette, make her an ideal fit for the
            job. She delights in donning her crisp uniform each morning,
            stocking her cart with miniature soaps and bottles, and returning
            guest rooms at the Regency Grand Hotel to a state of perfection. But
            Molly's orderly life is upended the day she enters the suite of the
            infamous and wealthy Charles Black, only to find it in a state of
            disarray and Mr. Black himself dead in his bed. Before she knows
            what's happening, Molly's unusual demeanor has the police targeting
            her as their lead suspect. She quickly finds herself caught in a web
            of deception, one she has no idea how to untangle. Fortunately for
            Molly, friends she never knew she had unite with her in a search for
            clues to what really happened to Mr. Black—but will they be able to
            find the real killer before it's too late? A Clue-like, locked-room
            mystery and a heartwarming journey of the spirit, The Maid explores
            what it means to be the same as everyone else and yet entirely
            different—and reveals that all mysteries can be solved through
            connection to the human heart.

            The award-winning, best-selling author of Station Eleven and The
            Glass Hotel returns with a novel of art, time travel, love, and
            plague that takes the reader from Vancouver Island in 1912 to a dark
            colony on the moon five hundred years later, unfurling a story of
            humanity across centuries and space. Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen
            years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from
            polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner
            party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the
            Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin
            echoing in an airship terminal--an experience that shocks him to his
            core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is
            on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the
            second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and
            artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic
            novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in
            the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest
            rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the
            black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the
            North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended:
            The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far
            from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from
            the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to
            do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the
            universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it
            is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time
            travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our
            current moment.

            Fresh out of rehab, Mallory Quinn takes a job in the affluent suburb
            of Spring Brook, New Jersey as a babysitter for Ted and Caroline
            Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son, Teddy.
            Mallory immediately loves this new job. She lives in the Maxwell’s
            pool house, goes out for nightly runs, and has the stability she
            craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a sweet, shy boy who is
            never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings are the usual
            fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws something
            different: a man in a forest, dragging a woman’s lifeless body. As
            the days pass, Teddy’s artwork becomes more and more sinister, and
            his stick figures steadily evolve into more detailed, complex, and
            lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any five-year-old.
            Mallory begins to suspect these are glimpses of an unsolved murder
            from long ago, perhaps relayed by a supernatural force lingering in
            the forest behind the Maxwell’s house. With help from a handsome
            landscaper and an eccentric neighbor, Mallory sets out to decipher
            the images and save Teddy—while coming to terms with a tragedy in
            her own past—before it’s too late.

            Bryce Quinlan and Hunt Athalar are trying to get back to normal―they
            may have saved Crescent City, but with so much upheaval in their
            lives lately, they mostly want a chance to relax. Slow down. Figure
            out what the future holds. The Asteri have kept their word so far,
            leaving Bryce and Hunt alone. But with the rebels chipping away at
            the Asteri’s power, the threat the rulers pose is growing. As Bryce,
            Hunt, and their friends get pulled into the rebels’ plans, the
            choice becomes clear: stay silent while others are oppressed, or
            fight for what’s right. And they’ve never been very good at staying
            silent. In this sexy, action-packed sequel to the #1 bestseller
            House of Earth and Blood, Sarah J. Maas weaves a captivating story
            of a world about to explode―and the people who will do anything to
