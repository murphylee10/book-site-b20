        "book-summary": `Molly Gray is not like everyone else. She struggles
            with social skills and misreads the intentions of others. Her gran
            used to interpret the world for her, codifying it into simple rules
            that Molly could live by. Since Gran died a few months ago,
            twenty-five-year-old Molly has been navigating life's complexities
            all by herself. No matter—she throws herself with gusto into her
            work as a hotel maid. Her unique character, along with her obsessive
            love of cleaning and proper etiquette, make her an ideal fit for the
            job. She delights in donning her crisp uniform each morning,
            stocking her cart with miniature soaps and bottles, and returning
            guest rooms at the Regency Grand Hotel to a state of perfection. But
            Molly's orderly life is upended the day she enters the suite of the
            infamous and wealthy Charles Black, only to find it in a state of
            disarray and Mr. Black himself dead in his bed. Before she knows
            what's happening, Molly's unusual demeanor has the police targeting
            her as their lead suspect. She quickly finds herself caught in a web
            of deception, one she has no idea how to untangle. Fortunately for
            Molly, friends she never knew she had unite with her in a search for
            clues to what really happened to Mr. Black—but will they be able to
            find the real killer before it's too late?`,

        "book-summary": `The award-winning, best-selling author of Station
            Eleven and The Glass Hotel returns with a novel of art, time travel,
            love, and plague that takes the reader from Vancouver Island in 1912
            to a dark colony on the moon five hundred years later, unfurling a
            story of humanity across centuries and space. Edwin St. Andrew is
            eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled
            from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner
            party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the
            Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin
            echoing in an airship terminal--an experience that shocks him to his
            core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is
            on a book tour. She's traveling all over Earth, but her home is the
            second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and
            artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive's best-selling pandemic
            novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in
            the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest
            rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the
            black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the
            North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended.`,

        "book-summary": `Fresh out of rehab, Mallory Quinn takes a job in the
            affluent suburb of Spring Brook, New Jersey as a babysitter for Ted
            and Caroline Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son,
            Teddy. Mallory immediately loves this new job. She lives in the
            Maxwell’s pool house, goes out for nightly runs, and has the
            stability she craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a sweet,
            shy boy who is never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings
            are the usual fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws
            something different: a man in a forest, dragging a woman’s lifeless
            body. As the days pass, Teddy’s artwork becomes more and more
            sinister, and his stick figures steadily evolve into more detailed,
            complex, and lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any
            five-year-old. Mallory begins to suspect these are glimpses of an
            unsolved murder from long ago, perhaps relayed by a supernatural
            force lingering in the forest behind the Maxwell’s house. With help
            from a handsome landscaper and an eccentric neighbor, Mallory sets
            out to decipher the images and save Teddy—while coming to terms with
            a tragedy in her own past—before it’s too late.`,

            back to normal―they may have saved Crescent City, but with so much
            upheaval in their lives lately, they mostly want a chance to relax.
            Slow down. Figure out what the future holds. The Asteri have kept
            their word so far, leaving Bryce and Hunt alone. But with the rebels
            chipping away at the Asteri’s power, the threat the rulers pose is
            growing. As Bryce, Hunt, and their friends get pulled into the
            rebels’ plans, the choice becomes clear: stay silent while others
            are oppressed, or fight for what’s right. And they’ve never been
            very good at staying silent. In this sexy, action-packed sequel to
            the #1 bestseller House of Earth and Blood, Sarah J. Maas weaves a
            captivating story of a world about to explode―and the people who
